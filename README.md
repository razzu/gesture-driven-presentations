All of this is a WIP and subject to a lot of modification :).

## Getting started (on Windows!)

So, first:
* install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/ . It should also come with pip.
* TIP: you could use a virtual environment. I use virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper, there's a nice tutorial here: http://www.tumblingprogrammer.com/setting-up-windows-for-python-development-python-2-python-3-git-bash-terminal-and-virtual-environments/#installing-virtual-environment-and-virtual-environment-wrapper
* install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* (best option we have so far) install PointerFocus (for some cursor functionalities that we will use): http://www.pointerfocus.com/

To see that everything works, try running `src/test_wrappers.py` :).
